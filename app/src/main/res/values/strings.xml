    <string name="object_of_game">Object of the game: \nCorrectly repeat a longer and longer sequence of signals</string>
    <string name="instructions">
        The game will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color.\n\n
        The game will duplicate the first signal and then add one.\n\n Repeat these two signals by pressing the same colors, in order.\n\n
        The game continues to repeat the same pattern and adds another signal every time you correctly repeat the pattern.\n\n
        After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, the game automatically speeds up.\n\n
       If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take more than 5 seconds to repeat a signal, you lose.</string>
